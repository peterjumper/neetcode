# [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

## 題目

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

```c
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

Example 2:

```c
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```c
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## 題目大意

給定一個有序數組 nums，對數組中的元素進行去重，使得原數組中的每個元素只有一個。最後返回去重以後數組的長度值。

## 解題思路

這道題和第 27 題很像。這道題和第 283 題，第 27 題基本一致，283 題是刪除 0，27 題是刪除指定元素，這一題是刪除重複元素，實質是一樣的。

這裏數組的刪除並不是真的刪除，只是將刪除的元素移動到數組後面的空間內，然後返回數組實際剩餘的元素個數，OJ 最終判斷題目的時候會讀取數組剩餘個數的元素進行輸出。
