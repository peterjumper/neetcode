# [80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/)

## 題目

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

```c
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

Example 2:

```c
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```c
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeElement(nums, val);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## 題目大意

給定一個有序數組 nums，對數組中的元素進行去重，使得原數組中的每個元素最多暴露 2 個。最後返回去重以後數組的長度值。

## 解題思路

- 問題提示有序數組，一般最容易想到使用雙指針的解法，雙指針的關鍵點：移動兩個指針的條件。
- 在該題中移動的條件：快指針從頭遍歷數組，慢指針指向修改後的數組的末端，當慢指針指向倒數第二個數與快指針指向的數不相等時，才移動慢指針，同時賦值慢指針。
- 處理邊界條件：當數組小於兩個元素時，不做處理。
