# [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/)


## 題目

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

    Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                 Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

**Example 2:**

    Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
                 Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
                 engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.

**Example 3:**

    Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## 題目大意

給定一個數組，它的第 i 個元素是一支給定股票第 i 天的價格。設計一個算法來計算你所能獲取的最大利潤。你可以儘可能地完成更多的交易（多次買賣一支股票）。注意：你不能同時參與多筆交易（你必須在再次購買前出售掉之前的股票）。


## 解題思路

- 這一題是第 121 題的加強版。要求輸出最大收益，這一題不止買賣一次，可以買賣多次，買賣不能在同一天內操作。
- 最大收益來源，必然是每次跌了就買入，漲到頂峯的時候就拋出。只要有漲峯就開始計算賺的錢，連續漲可以用兩兩相減累加來計算，兩兩相減累加，相當於漲到波峯的最大值減去谷底的值。這一點看通以後，題目非常簡單。
