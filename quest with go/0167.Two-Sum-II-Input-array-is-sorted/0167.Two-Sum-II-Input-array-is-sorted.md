# [167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)

## 題目

Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

Note:

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

```c
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

## 題目大意

找出兩個數之和等於 target 的兩個數字，要求輸出它們的下標。注意一個數字不能使用 2 次。下標從小到大輸出。假定題目一定有一個解。

## 解題思路

這一題比第 1 題 Two Sum 的問題還要簡單，因為這裏數組是有序的。可以直接用第一題的解法解決這道題。
