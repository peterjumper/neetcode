# [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

## 題目


Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

Note:   

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.


Example:

```c
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

## 題目大意

輸出一顆完全二叉樹的結點個數。

## 解題思路

這道題其實按照層序遍歷一次樹，然後把每一層的結點個數相加即可。
