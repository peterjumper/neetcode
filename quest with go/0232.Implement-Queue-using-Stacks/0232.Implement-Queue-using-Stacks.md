# [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)

## 題目

Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

- push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
- pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
- peek() -- Get the front element.
- empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.

Example :

```c
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false
```

Note:  

- You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
 

## 題目大意
