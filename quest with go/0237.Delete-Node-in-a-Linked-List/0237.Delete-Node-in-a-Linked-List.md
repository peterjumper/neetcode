# [237. Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)

## 題目

Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = [4,5,1,9], which looks like following:

Example 1:

```c
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

Example 2:

```c
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

Note:

- The linked list will have at least two elements.
- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- The given node will not be the tail and it will always be a valid node of the linked list.
- Do not return anything from your function.

## 題目大意

刪除給點結點。沒有給鏈表的頭結點。

## 解題思路

其實就是把後面的結點都覆蓋上來即可。或者直接當前結點的值等於下一個結點，Next 指針指向下下個結點，這樣做也可以，只不過中間有一個結點不被釋放，內存消耗多一些。
