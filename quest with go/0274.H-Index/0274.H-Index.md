# [274. H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

## 題目

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example 1:

```c
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

Note: 

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.



## 題目大意

求 h-index。h-index 值的定義：如果他/她的 N 篇論文中至少有 h 引用，而其他 N-h 論文的引用數不超過 h 引用數。

## 解題思路

可以先將數組裏面的數從小到大排序。因為要找最大的 h-index，所以從數組末尾開始往前找，找到第一個數組的值，小於，總長度減去下標的值，這個值就是 h-index。
