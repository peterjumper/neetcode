# [451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/)

## 題目

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.


Example 1:

```c
Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:

```c
Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

Example 3:

```c
Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```




## 題目大意

這道題是 Google 的面試題。

給定一個字符串，要求根據字符出現的頻次從高到低重新排列這個字符串。

## 解題思路

思路比較簡單，首先統計每個字符的頻次，然後排序，最後按照頻次從高到低進行輸出即可。
