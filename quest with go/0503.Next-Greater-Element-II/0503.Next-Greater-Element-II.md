# [503. Next Greater Element II](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-ii/)

## 題目

Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:

```c
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number; 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

## 題目大意

題目給出數組 A，針對 A 中的每個數組中的元素，要求在 A 數組中找出比該元素大的數，A 是一個循環數組。如果找到了就輸出這個值，如果找不到就輸出 -1。


## 解題思路

這題是第 496 題的加強版，在第 496 題的基礎上增加了循環數組的條件。這一題可以依舊按照第 496 題的做法繼續模擬。更好的做法是用單調棧，棧中記錄單調遞增的下標。
