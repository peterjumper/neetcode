# [819. Most Common Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/)


## 題目

Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words. It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn't banned, and that the answer is unique.

Words in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation. Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive. The answer is in lowercase.

**Example:**

    Input: 
    paragraph = "Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."
    banned = ["hit"]
    Output: "ball"
    Explanation: 
    "hit" occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.
    "ball" occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. 
    Note that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,
    that punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as "ball,"), 
    and that "hit" isn't the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.

**Note:**

- `1 <= paragraph.length <= 1000`.
- `0 <= banned.length <= 100`.
- `1 <= banned[i].length <= 10`.
- The answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in `paragraph` may have uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)
- `paragraph` only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols `!?',;.`
- There are no hyphens or hyphenated words.
- Words only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.


## 題目大意


給定一個段落 (paragraph) 和一個禁用單詞列表 (banned)。返回出現次數最多，同時不在禁用列表中的單詞。題目保證至少有一個詞不在禁用列表中，而且答案唯一。

禁用列表中的單詞用小寫字母表示，不含標點符號。段落中的單詞不區分大小寫。答案都是小寫字母。


## 解題思路

- 給出一段話和一個 banned 的字符串，要求輸出這段話中出現頻次最高的並且不出現在 banned 數組裏面的字符串，答案唯一。這題是簡單題，依次統計每個單詞的頻次，然後從 map 中刪除 banned 裏面的單詞，取出剩下頻次最高的單詞即可。
