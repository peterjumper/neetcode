# [826. Most Profit Assigning Work](https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work/)

## 題目

We have jobs: difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith job, and profit[i] is the profit of the ith job. 

Now we have some workers. worker[i] is the ability of the ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[i]. 

Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.

What is the most profit we can make?


Example 1:


```c
Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100 
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.
```

Note:

- 1 <= difficulty.length = profit.length <= 10000
- 1 <= worker.length <= 10000
- difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i]  are in range [1, 10^5]


## 題目大意

這道題考察的是滑動窗口的問題，也是排序相關的問題。

給出一組任務，每個任務都有一定的難度，每個任務也都有完成以後對應的收益(完成難的任務不一定收益最高)。有一批工人，每個人能處理的任務難度不同。要求輸出這批工人完成任務以後的最大收益。

## 解題思路

先將任務按照難度排序，工人也按照能處理任務難度的能力排序。用一個數組記錄下，每個 i 下標，當前能達到的最大收益。計算這個收益只需要從下標為 1 開始，依次比較自己和前一個的收益即可(因為排過序，難度是依次遞增的)。有了這個難度依次遞增，並且記錄了最大收益的數組以後，就可以計算最終結果了。遍歷一遍工人數組，如果工人的能力大於任務的難度，就加上這個最大收益。遍歷完工人數組，最終結果就是最大收益。
