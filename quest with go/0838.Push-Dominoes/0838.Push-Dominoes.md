# [838. Push Dominoes](https://leetcode.com/problems/push-dominoes/)

## 題目

There are N dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright.

In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.

After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left.

Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.

When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.

For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

Given a string "S" representing the initial state. S[i] = 'L', if the i-th domino has been pushed to the left; S[i] = 'R', if the i-th domino has been pushed to the right; S[i] = '.', if the i-th domino has not been pushed.

Return a string representing the final state. 


Example 1:

```c
Input: ".L.R...LR..L.."
Output: "LL.RR.LLRRLL.."
```

Example 2:

```c
Input: "RR.L"
Output: "RR.L"
Explanation: The first domino expends no additional force on the second domino.
```


Note:

- 0 <= N <= 10^5
- String dominoes contains only 'L', 'R' and '.'


## 題目大意

這道題是一個道模擬題，考察的也是滑動窗口的問題。

給出一個字符串，L 代表這個多米諾骨牌會往左邊倒，R 代表這個多米諾骨牌會往右邊倒，問最終這些牌倒下去以後，情況是如何的，輸出最終情況的字符串。

## 解題思路

這道題可以預先在初始字符串頭和尾都添加一個字符串，左邊添加 L，右邊添加 R，輔助判斷。
