# [901. Online Stock Span](https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/)

## 題目

Write a class StockSpanner which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85], then the stock spans would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6].

 

Example 1:

```c
Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]
Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]
Explanation: 
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.

Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
```

Note:

1. Calls to StockSpanner.next(int price) will have 1 <= price <= 10^5.
2. There will be at most 10000 calls to StockSpanner.next per test case.
3. There will be at most 150000 calls to StockSpanner.next across all test cases.
4. The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and 50% for all other languages.

## 題目大意

編寫一個 StockSpanner 類，它收集某些股票的每日報價，並返回該股票當日價格的跨度。

今天股票價格的跨度被定義為股票價格小於或等於今天價格的最大連續日數（從今天開始往回數，包括今天）。

例如，如果未來7天股票的價格是 [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]，那麼股票跨度將是 [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]。
