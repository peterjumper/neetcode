# [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets/)

## 題目

In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].

You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:

1. Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
2. Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.

Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.

You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.

What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?


Example 1:

```c
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].
```

Example 2:

```c
Input: [0,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [0, 1].
```

Example 3:

```c
Input: [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can collect [2,3,2,2].
If we started at the first tree, we would only collect [1, 2].
```

Example 4:

```c
Input: [3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1,1,2].
If we started at the first tree or the eighth tree, we would only collect 4 fruits.
```

Note:

- 1 <= tree.length <= 40000
- 0 <= tree[i] < tree.length

## 題目大意

這道題考察的是滑動窗口的問題。

給出一個數組，數組裏面的數字代表每個果樹上水果的種類，1 代表一號水果，不同數字代表的水果不同。現在有 2 個籃子，每個籃子只能裝一個種類的水果，這就意味着只能選 2 個不同的數字。摘水果只能從左往右摘，直到右邊沒有水果可以摘就停下。問可以連續摘水果的最長區間段的長度。


## 解題思路

簡化一下題意，給出一段數字，要求找出包含 2 個不同數字的最大區間段長度。這個區間段內只能包含這 2 個不同數字，可以重複，但是不能包含其他數字。

用典型的滑動窗口的處理方法處理即可。
