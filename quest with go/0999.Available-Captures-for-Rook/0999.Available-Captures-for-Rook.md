# [999. Available Captures for Rook](https://leetcode.com/problems/available-captures-for-rook/)


## 題目

On an 8 x 8 chessboard, there is one white rook. There also may be empty squares, white bishops, and black pawns. These are given as characters 'R', '.', 'B', and 'p' respectively. Uppercase characters represent white pieces, and lowercase characters represent black pieces.

The rook moves as in the rules of Chess: it chooses one of four cardinal directions (north, east, west, and south), then moves in that direction until it chooses to stop, reaches the edge of the board, or captures an opposite colored pawn by moving to the same square it occupies. Also, rooks cannot move into the same square as other friendly bishops.

Return the number of pawns the rook can capture in one move.

Explanation: 
The rook can capture the pawns at positions b5, d6 and f5.
```

**Note**:

1. `board.length == board[i].length == 8`
2. `board[i][j]` is either `'R'`, `'.'`, `'B'`, or `'p'`
3. There is exactly one cell with `board[i][j] == 'R'`

## 題目大意

在一個 8 x 8 的棋盤上，有一個白色的車（Rook），用字符 'R' 表示。棋盤上還可能存在空方塊，白色的象（Bishop）以及黑色的卒（pawn），分別用字符 '.'，'B' 和 'p' 表示。不難看出，大寫字符表示的是白棋，小寫字符表示的是黑棋。車按國際象棋中的規則移動。東，西，南，北四個基本方向任選其一，然後一直向選定的方向移動，直到滿足下列四個條件之一：

- 棋手選擇主動停下來。
- 棋子因到達棋盤的邊緣而停下。
- 棋子移動到某一方格來捕獲位於該方格上敵方（黑色）的卒，停在該方格內。
- 車不能進入/越過已經放有其他友方棋子（白色的象）的方格，停在友方棋子前。

你現在可以控制車移動一次，請你統計有多少敵方的卒處於你的捕獲範圍內（即，可以被一步捕獲的棋子數）。

## 解題思路

- 按照國際象棋的規則移動車，要求輸出只移動一次，有多少個卒在車的捕獲範圍之內
- 簡單題，按照國際象棋車的移動規則， 4 個方向分別枚舉即可。

## 代碼

```go
package leetcode

func numRookCaptures(board [][]byte) int {
	num := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(board); i++ {
		for j := 0; j < len(board[i]); j++ {
			if board[i][j] == 'R' {
				num += caputure(board, i-1, j, -1, 0) // Up
				num += caputure(board, i+1, j, 1, 0)  // Down
				num += caputure(board, i, j-1, 0, -1) // Left
				num += caputure(board, i, j+1, 0, 1)  // Right
			}
		}
	}
	return num
}

func caputure(board [][]byte, x, y int, bx, by int) int {
	for x >= 0 && x < len(board) && y >= 0 && y < len(board[x]) && board[x][y] != 'B' {
		if board[x][y] == 'p' {
			return 1
		}
		x += bx
		y += by
	}
	return 0
}
