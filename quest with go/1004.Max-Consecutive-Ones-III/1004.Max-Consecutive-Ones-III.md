# [1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-iii/)

## 題目

Given an array A of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K values from 0 to 1.

Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s. 


Example 1:

```c
Input: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```

Example 2:

```c
Input: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: 
[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.
```


Note:

- 1 <= A.length <= 20000
- 0 <= K <= A.length
- A[i] is 0 or 1 


## 題目大意

這道題考察的是滑動窗口的問題。

給出一個數組，數組中元素只包含 0 和 1 。再給一個 K，代表能將 0 變成 1 的次數。要求出經過變換以後，1 連續的最長長度。

## 解題思路

按照滑動窗口的思路處理即可，不斷的更新和維護最大長度。
