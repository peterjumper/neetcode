# [1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/)

## 題目

Given a string S of lowercase letters, a duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing them.

We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.  It is guaranteed the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

```c
Input: "abbaca"
Output: "ca"
Explanation: 
For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".
```

Note:

1. 1 <= S.length <= 20000
2. S consists only of English lowercase letters.


## 題目大意

給出由小寫字母組成的字符串 S，重複項刪除操作會選擇兩個相鄰且相同的字母，並刪除它們。在 S 上反覆執行重複項刪除操作，直到無法繼續刪除。在完成所有重複項刪除操作後返回最終的字符串。答案保證唯一。


## 解題思路

用棧模擬，類似“對對碰”，一旦新來的字符和棧頂的字符一樣的話，就彈出棧頂字符，直至掃完整個字符串。棧中剩下的字符串就是最終要輸出的結果。
