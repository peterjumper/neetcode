# [1629. Slowest Key](https://leetcode.com/problems/slowest-key/)


## 題目

A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of `n` keys, one at a time.

You are given a string `keysPressed` of length `n`, where `keysPressed[i]` was the `ith` key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list `releaseTimes`, where `releaseTimes[i]` was the time the `ith` key was released. Both arrays are **0-indexed**. The `0th` key was pressed at the time `0`, and every subsequent key was pressed at the **exact** time the previous key was released.

The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the **longest duration**. The `ith` keypress had a **duration** of `releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1]`, and the `0th` keypress had a duration of `releaseTimes[0]`.

Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key **may not** have had the same **duration**.

*Return the key of the keypress that had the **longest duration**. If there are multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the keypresses.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = "cbcd"
Output: "c"
Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9).
Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29).
Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49).
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50).
The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20.
'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: releaseTimes = [12,23,36,46,62], keysPressed = "spuda"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The keypresses were as follows:
Keypress for 's' had a duration of 12.
Keypress for 'p' had a duration of 23 - 12 = 11.
Keypress for 'u' had a duration of 36 - 23 = 13.
Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 46 - 36 = 10.
Keypress for 'a' had a duration of 62 - 46 = 16.
The longest of these was the keypress for 'a' with duration 16.
```

**Constraints:**

- `releaseTimes.length == n`
- `keysPressed.length == n`
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= releaseTimes[i] <= 109`
- `releaseTimes[i] < releaseTimes[i+1]`
- `keysPressed` contains only lowercase English letters.

## 題目大意

LeetCode 設計了一款新式鍵盤，正在測試其可用性。測試人員將會點擊一系列鍵（總計 n 個），每次一個。

給你一個長度為 n 的字符串 keysPressed ，其中 keysPressed[i] 表示測試序列中第 i 個被按下的鍵。releaseTimes 是一個升序排列的列表，其中 releaseTimes[i] 表示鬆開第 i 個鍵的時間。字符串和數組的 下標都從 0 開始 。第 0 個鍵在時間為 0 時被按下，接下來每個鍵都 恰好 在前一個鍵鬆開時被按下。測試人員想要找出按鍵 持續時間最長 的鍵。第 i 次按鍵的持續時間為 releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1] ，第 0 次按鍵的持續時間為 releaseTimes[0] 。

注意，測試期間，同一個鍵可以在不同時刻被多次按下，而每次的持續時間都可能不同。請返回按鍵 持續時間最長 的鍵，如果有多個這樣的鍵，則返回 按字母順序排列最大 的那個鍵。

## 解題思路

- 題幹很長，不過還是簡單題。循環掃描一遍數組，計算出每個按鍵的持續時間。動態更新按鍵最長時間的鍵。如果持續時間最長的有多個鍵，需要返回字母序最大的那一個鍵。

## 代碼

```go
package leetcode

func slowestKey(releaseTimes []int, keysPressed string) byte {
	longestDuration, key := releaseTimes[0], keysPressed[0]
	for i := 1; i < len(releaseTimes); i++ {
		duration := releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i-1]
		if duration > longestDuration {
			longestDuration = duration
			key = keysPressed[i]
		} else if duration == longestDuration && keysPressed[i] > key {
			key = keysPressed[i]
		}
	}
	return key
}
```
